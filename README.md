## Hey, ðŸ‘‹

I'm Narmis - A Linux enthusiast, self-diagnosed professional desktop ricer and highschool student. I Use a Lenovo Legion 5 (2022) for dualbooting Archlinux, Fedora 37 and Windows 10. I pirate most of my games and media because; bad corpos, I don't have the money and I love sailing the seven seas.
